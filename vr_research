Virtual Reality
	The main idea behind virtual reality is the creation of a digital environment that is so immersive that it replicates, or in some cases, goes beyond our reality. VR can be used for training simulations, art pieces, video games, among other things. VR currently works by giving the user a headset, and projecting images in a way that makes them appear 3D.

	Currently, the biggest names in VR are Oculus, Sony (Playstation VR), Samsung, HTC, and Google. VR was used in video games as early as the 80s, becoming more popular in the home consumer market in the 90s, with Sega and Nintendo both releasing VR peripherals. These companies are important to my research due to their representation of the initial trial run of VR to the consumer, and then newest, more successful run by companies like Sony.

	Some important dates to me would be 1991, when the first cubic immersive room was created, and also Sega VR and Virtuality launched, 1992, when Angels, the first interactive immersive movie, was created, 1995, when the Nintendo Virtual Boy was released, and 2012, when Oculus was presented at e3 by John Carmack.

	An obvious technology linked to VR would be AR, or augmented reality, as both seek to alter our own reality. Also video games, specifically of the 80s, 90s, and 2010s.
