A flame war is essentially an argument over an online post, usually over something meant to be taken as a joke. Emoticons were used at Carnegie Mellon University to distinguish joke posts from serious posts on their BBS system.

The difference between emoticons and emojis initially was that emojis did not require you to tilt your head to see them properly, however, nowadays an emoticon is the creation of a face via characters while an emoji is a designed character, more like a drawing, not made with text.

The idea of lossy compression, especially in the case of a jpeg is essentially, everytime the file is opened you lose part of it, as images canâ€™t be saved in a lossless file format. Lossless compression is associated with text and data files. In order to get a lossless photo file, you should shoot in RAW files rather than jpegs to prevent compression, then save your images as tif files to prevent data loss.

Other types of metadata can be location metadata in smartphone photos, framerate and resolution in video files, and information on call detail records.
