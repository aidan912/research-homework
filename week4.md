Research Homework
VR. 	The introduction of VR to an audience of everyday consumers, rather than to a hardcore fanbase, is a very interesting development. To me, VR isn’t something I’m personally a huge fan of, but I think in the coming years, some software for it could be very compelling for me. To me, the drawback of VR is it’s lack of compelling software, but with talented developers working on software I could see it hitting mainstream soon.
Dating apps. I feel like we’re seeing the internet evolve into what it was dreamt to be with dating apps, the internet slowly taking over our lives to the point where everyone is using it to date now. I know people who have used it successfully, I met my girlfriend on Tinder, but in a way it’s strange that we’ve come so far that you can meet someone online and it’s not looked down upon like it once was.
Online Communities (Reddit) ( technically outside the time frame slightly but hear me out). Reddit is something I’ve personally been on for years, and it’s interesting to see the influence these communities can have on people. We create these bubbles and seeing people interact inside of them can be frightening. The internet is supposed to be about free expression, but on sites like reddit and tumblr, they end up become echo chambers for people of the same ilk to parrot opinions at each other.
Touchscreens becoming incredibly common. For me personally, seeing touch screens become common was mind blowing as a child, I can still remember my first time using one. This one is interesting for me because I don’t see how we could progress much further with touch screens, perhaps we’ll start to see them phased out in favor of a new technology
Streaming services. My personal favorite and most important, a legal, cheap way to access so much great entertainment, and it’s really contributed to widespread entertainment literacy in my opinion. I’ve watched and listened to so many I things I wouldn’t have given a chance because they popped up on streaming. However, I feel that recently companies have become wise to streaming, and the various splintering of services will only lead to people buying them less, at least to me personally.
