Dear Diary,
	School was fun today. Fourth grade is harder than third grade was, but I’ve been having fun recently. We visited Greece and Rome today, and then went to Hawaii after lunch. Tomorrow we’re gonna visit the Space Needle, and Mrs. Martell says if we’re good,we get to pick where we visit!!!!!!!!!! I can’t wait for school tomorrow!

Dear Diary,
	Today was a bit boring. Just plain old reading. History and spelling, then science for the rest of school. Tomorrow is just gonna be writing. Asked Mom if Santa could bring me a headset for Christmas, the commercials look so fun, but she said Santa ran out, and maybe he’d have more next year. I hope Santa brings me one soon.
